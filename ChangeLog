	explicitly (to be used on withdraw, refresh and tipping).

	Changed a few function signatures to use new structs. -CG

	Releasing Taler v0.4.0. -CG

Tue Oct 17 14:32:46 CEST 2017

	signature set instead of partial map. -CG

Mon Oct 16 12:10:35 CEST 2017
	Realize JSON-based report formats from auditor (#4963). -CG

Fri Jul 14 17:38:54 CEST 2017
	Fix #4751 by not allowing denomination deletion (GC)
	to cascade into reserve_out table (and tolerating such
	deletion failures). This way, denominations will be kept
	around until the last reserve that references them (or
	known_coins derived from them) is closed. Naturally, in
	most case we expect reserves to be closed much faster
	than DKs, so in practice this should rarely apply. -CG

Sun Jun 11 17:03:56 CEST 2017
	Finish implementation and testing of automated refunding
	of expired reserves (#4956). -CG

	APIs (#4569). -CG

Tue Jun  7 15:13:46 CEST 2016
        Adding public key of the exchange that was used to sign replies
        to applicable callbacks of libtalerexchange. (This will eventually
        be needed by the merchant's backend.) -CG
