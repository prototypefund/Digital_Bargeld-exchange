    Pass hash of denomination public key in operations from

	Add TALER_EXCHANGE_refund2() API call to libtalerexchange. -CG

Thu Dec 14 15:32:50 CET 2017
	Replaced taler-exchange-reservemod tool with new taler-bank-transfer
	tool (#5195).  Removed /admin/add/incoming API, replaced by new
	taler-exchange-wirewatch tooling. (#5077).

Sat Dec  9 15:21:50 CET 2071
	Implement refresh protocol optimization, bumping protocol version
	to v2 (#5178). -CG

Thu Nov  2 17:39:40 CET 2017
	Limit amount values to 2^53 as we always wanted (#5167). -CG

Thu Nov  2 16:50:46 CET 2017

	fees were not always properly included in the summation. -CG

Tue Oct 31 13:43:55 CET 2017

	explicitly (to be used on withdraw, refresh and tipping).

Fri Jul 14 17:38:54 CEST 2017
	Fix #4751 by not allowing denomination deletion (GC)
	to cascade into reserve_out table (and tolerating such
	deletion failures). This way, denominations will be kept
	around until the last reserve that references them (or
	known_coins derived from them) is closed. Naturally, in
	most case we expect reserves to be closed much faster
	than DKs, so in practice this should rarely apply. -CG
