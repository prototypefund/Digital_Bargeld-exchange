/**
 * Submit a refund request to the exchange and get the exchange's

 * while we return the response verbatim to the caller for further
 * processing, we do already verify that the response is well-formed
 * (i.e. that signatures included in the response are all valid).  If
 * the exchange's reply is not well-formed, we return an HTTP status code
 * of zero to @a cb.
 *
 * The @a exchange must be ready to operate (i.e.  have
 * finished processing the /keys reply).  If this check fails, we do
 * NOT initiate the transaction with the exchange and instead return NULL.
 *
 * @param exchange the exchange handle; the exchange must be ready to operate
 * @param amount the amount to be refunded; must be larger than the refund fee
 *        (as that fee is still being subtracted), and smaller than the amount
 *        (with deposit fee) of the original deposit contribution of this coin
 * @param refund_fee fee applicable to this coin for the refund
 * @param h_contract hash of the contact of the merchant with the customer that is being refunded
 * @param transaction_id transaction id for the transaction being refunded, must match @a h_contract
 * @param coin_pub coinâ€™s public key of the coin from the original deposit operation
 * @param rtransaction_id transaction id for the transaction between merchant and customer (of refunding operation);
 *                        this is needed as we may first do a partial refund and later a full refund.  If both
 *                        refunds are also over the same amount, we need the @a rtransaction_id to make the disjoint
 *                        refund requests different (as requests are idempotent and otherwise the 2nd refund might not work).
 * @param merchant_priv the private key of the merchant, used to generate signature for refund request
 * @param cb the callback to call when a reply for this request is available
 * @param cb_cls closure for the above callback
 * @return a handle for this request; NULL if the inputs are invalid (i.e.
 *         signatures fail to verify).  In this case, the callback is not called.
