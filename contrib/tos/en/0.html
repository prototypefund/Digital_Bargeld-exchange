<h1>Terms Of Service - Last Updated: 12.4.2019</h1>

<p>
 Welcome!  Taler Systems SA (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a payment service
through our Internet presence (collectively the “Services”). Before using our
Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”)
carefully.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This
section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement.
Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting
all of the terms and conditions and not just this section. We and
possibly other third parties provide Internet services which interact
with the Taler Wallet’s self-hosted personal payment application.
When using the Taler Wallet to interact with our Services, you are
agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.
</p>
<p>Highlights:
<ul>
	<li>You
	are responsible for keeping the data in your Taler Wallet at all
	times under your control. Any losses arising from you not being in
	control of your private information are your problem.
	<li>We
	will try to transfer funds we hold in escrow for our users to any
	legal recipient to the best of our ability within the limitations of
	the law and our implementation. However, the Services offered today
	are highly experimental and the set of recipients of funds is
	severely restricted.
	<li>For
	our Services, we may charge transaction fees. The specific fee
	structure is provided based on the Taler protocol and should be
	shown to you when you withdraw electronic coins using a Taler
	Wallet. You agree and understand that the Taler protocol allows for
	the fee structure to change.
	<li>You
	agree to not intentionally overwhelm our systems with requests and
	follow responsible disclosure if you find security issues in our
	services.
	<li>We
	cannot be held accountable for our Services not being available due
	to circumstances beyond our control. If we modify or terminate our
	services, we will try to give you the opportunity to recover your
	funds. However, given the experimental state of the Services today,
	this may not be possible. You are strongly advised to limit your use
	of the Service to small-scale experiments expecting total loss of
	all funds.
</ul></p>
<p>These
terms outline approved uses of our Services. The Services and these
Terms are still at an experimental stage. If you have any questions
or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message to
legal@taler-systems.com. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you
must not use our Services.
</p>
<h2>How you accept this policy</h2>
<p>By
sending funds to us (to top-up your Taler Wallet), you acknowledge
that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. We reserve
the right to change these Terms at any time. If you disagree with the
change, we may in the future offer you with an easy option to recover
your unspent funds. However, in the current experimental period you
acknowledge that this feature is not yet available, resulting in your
funds being lost unless you accept the new Terms. If you continue to
use our Services other than to recover your unspent funds, your
continued use of our Services following any such change will signify
your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check
the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes
since you have last reviewed these Terms.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>We
will try to transfer funds that we hold in escrow for our users to
any legal recipient to the best of our ability and within the
limitations of the law and our implementation. However, the Services
offered today are highly experimental and the set of recipients of
funds is severely restricted.</p>
<p>The
Taler Wallet can be loaded by exchanging fiat currencies against
electronic coins. We are providing this exchange service. Once your
Taler Wallet is loaded with electronic coins they can be spent for
purchases if the seller is accepting Taler as a means of payment. We
are not guaranteeing that any seller is accepting Taler at all or a
particular seller.</p>
<p>The
seller or recipient of deposits of electronic coins must specify the
target account, as per the design of the Taler protocol. They are
responsible for following the protocol and specifying the correct
bank account, and are solely liable for any losses that may arise
from specifying the wrong account. We will allow the government to
link wire transfers to the underlying contract hash. It is the
responsibility of recipients to preserve the full contracts and to
pay whatever taxes and charges may be applicable. Technical issues
may lead to situations where we are unable to make transfers at all
or lead to incorrect transfers that cannot be reversed. We will only
refuse to execute transfers if the transfers are prohibited by a
competent legal authority and we are ordered to do so.</p>

</p>
<h2>FEES</h2>
<p>You
agree to pay the fees for exchanges and withdrawals completed via the
Taler Wallet (&quot;Fees&quot;) as defined by us, which we may change
from time to time. With the exception of wire transfer fees, Taler
transaction fees are set for any electronic coin at the time of
withdrawal and fixed throughout the validity period of the respective
electronic coin. Your wallet should obtain and display applicable
fees when withdrawing funds. Fees for coins obtained as change may
differ from the fees applicable to the original coin. Wire transfer
fees that are independent from electronic coins may change annually.
</p>
<p>You
authorize us to charge or deduct applicable fees owed in connection
with deposits, exchanges and withdrawals following the rules of the
Taler protocol.</p>
<p>We
reserve the right to provide different types of rewards to users
either in the form of discount for our Services or in any other form
at our discretion and without prior notice to you.</p>
<h2>ELIGIBILITY</h2>
<p>To
be eligible to use our Services, you must be able to form legally
binding contracts or have the permission of your legal guardian. By
using our Services, you represent and warrant that you meet all
eligibility requirements that we outline in these Terms.
</p>
<p>FINANCIAL SELF-RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>You
will be responsible for maintaining the availability, integrity and
confidentiality of the data stored in your wallet. When you setup a
Taler Wallet, you are strongly advised to follow the precautionary
measures offered by the software to minimize the chances to losse
access to or control over your Wallet data. We will not be liable for
any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this
paragraph.
