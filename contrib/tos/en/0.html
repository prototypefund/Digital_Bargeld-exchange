<h1>Terms Of Service<a class="headerlink" href="#terms-of-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Last Updated: 12.4.2019</p>
<p>Welcome! Taler Systems SA (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a payment service
through our Internet presence (collectively the “Services”). Before using our
Services, please read the Terms of Service (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”)
carefully.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section provides a brief summary of the highlights of this
Agreement. Please note that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting
all of the terms and conditions and not just this section. We and possibly
other third parties provide Internet services which interact with the Taler
Wallet’s self-hosted personal payment application. When using the Taler Wallet
to interact with our Services, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read
carefully.</p>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h3>Highlights:<a class="headerlink" href="#highlights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>You are responsible for keeping the data in your Taler Wallet at all times
under your control. Any losses arising from you not being in control of
your private information are your problem.</li>
<li>We will try to transfer funds we hold in escrow for our users to any legal
recipient to the best of our ability within the limitations of the law and
our implementation. However, the Services offered today are highly
experimental and the set of recipients of funds is severely restricted.</li>
<li>For our Services, we may charge transaction fees. The specific fee structure
is provided based on the Taler protocol and should be shown to you when you
withdraw electronic coins using a Taler Wallet. You agree and understand
that the Taler protocol allows for the fee structure to change.</li>
<li>You agree to not intentionally overwhelm our systems with requests and
follow responsible disclosure if you find security issues in our services.</li>
<li>We cannot be held accountable for our Services not being available due to
circumstances beyond our control. If we modify or terminate our services,
we will try to give you the opportunity to recover your funds. However,
given the experimental state of the Services today, this may not be
possible. You are strongly advised to limit your use of the Service
to small-scale experiments expecting total loss of all funds.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These terms outline approved uses of our Services. The Services and these
Terms are still at an experimental stage. If you have any questions or
comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:legal&#37;&#52;&#48;taler-systems&#46;com">legal<span>&#64;</span>taler-systems<span>&#46;</span>com</a>. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you must not
use our Services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-you-accept-this-policy">
<h2>How you accept this policy<a class="headerlink" href="#how-you-accept-this-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By sending funds to us (to top-up your Taler Wallet), you acknowledge that you
have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. We reserve the right to
change these Terms at any time. If you disagree with the change, we may in the
future offer you with an easy option to recover your unspent funds. However,
in the current experimental period you acknowledge that this feature is not
yet available, resulting in your funds being lost unless you accept the new
Terms. If you continue to use our Services other than to recover your unspent
funds, your continued use of our Services following any such change will
signify your acceptance to be bound by the then current Terms. Please check
the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you
have last reviewed these Terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="services">
<h2>Services<a class="headerlink" href="#services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will try to transfer funds that we hold in escrow for our users to any
legal recipient to the best of our ability and within the limitations of the
law and our implementation. However, the Services offered today are highly
experimental and the set of recipients of funds is severely restricted.  The
Taler Wallet can be loaded by exchanging fiat currencies against electronic
coins. We are providing this exchange service. Once your Taler Wallet is
loaded with electronic coins they can be spent for purchases if the seller is
accepting Taler as a means of payment. We are not guaranteeing that any seller
is accepting Taler at all or a particular seller.  The seller or recipient of
deposits of electronic coins must specify the target account, as per the
design of the Taler protocol. They are responsible for following the protocol
and specifying the correct bank account, and are solely liable for any losses
that may arise from specifying the wrong account. We will allow the government
to link wire transfers to the underlying contract hash. It is the
responsibility of recipients to preserve the full contracts and to pay
whatever taxes and charges may be applicable. Technical issues may lead to
situations where we are unable to make transfers at all or lead to incorrect
transfers that cannot be reversed. We will only refuse to execute transfers if
the transfers are prohibited by a competent legal authority and we are ordered
to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fees">
<h2>Fees<a class="headerlink" href="#fees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You agree to pay the fees for exchanges and withdrawals completed via the
Taler Wallet (“Fees”) as defined by us, which we may change from time to
time. With the exception of wire transfer fees, Taler transaction fees are set
for any electronic coin at the time of withdrawal and fixed throughout the
validity period of the respective electronic coin. Your wallet should obtain
and display applicable fees when withdrawing funds. Fees for coins obtained as
change may differ from the fees applicable to the original coin. Wire transfer
fees that are independent from electronic coins may change annually.  You
authorize us to charge or deduct applicable fees owed in connection with
deposits, exchanges and withdrawals following the rules of the Taler protocol.
We reserve the right to provide different types of rewards to users either in
the form of discount for our Services or in any other form at our discretion
and without prior notice to you.</p>

<h2>Eligibility<a class="headerlink" href="#eligibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
