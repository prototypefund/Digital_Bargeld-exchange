        <title>Privacy Policy</title>
        <paragraph>Last Updated: 11.12.2019</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Taler Systems SA
            (“we,” “our,” or “us”) pertaining to the collection, use, and disclosure of
            your information on our sites and related mobile applications and products we
            offer (the “Services” or “Taler Wallet”). This Privacy Statement applies to
            your personal data when you use our Services, and does not apply to online
            websites or services that we do not own or control.</paragraph>
        <section ids="overview" names="overview">
            <title>Overview</title>
            <paragraph>Your privacy is important to us. We follow a few fundamental principles: We
                don’t ask you for personally identifiable information (defined below). That
                being said, your contact information, such as your phone number, social media
                handle, or email address (depending on how you contact us), may be collected
                when you communicate with us, for example to report a bug or other error
                related to the Taler Wallet. We don’t share your information with third
                parties except when strictly required to deliver you our Services and
                products, or to comply with the law. If you have any questions or concerns
                about this policy, please reach out to us at <reference refuri="mailto:privacy@taler-systems.net">privacy@taler-systems.net</reference>.</paragraph>

            <title>How you accept this policy</title>
            <paragraph>By using our Services or visiting our sites, you agree to the use, disclosure,
                and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</paragraph>

            <title>What personal information do we collect from our users?</title>
            <paragraph>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally
                identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an
                individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable
                information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are)
                (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and
                will tell you how we might collect and use each type.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We do our best to not collect any Personal Information from Taler Wallet
                users. We believe that the Taler Wallet never transmits personal information
                to our services without at least clear implied consent, and we only process
                and retain information with a strict business need. That being said, when
                using our Services, we inherently have to collect the following information:</paragraph>

Note that for purchases, we cannot identify the buyer from the collected data, so when you spend money, we only receive non-personal information.</paragraph>
