<h1>Privacy Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Last Updated: 11.12.2019</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Taler Systems SA
(“we,” “our,” or “us”) pertaining to the collection, use, and disclosure of
your information on our sites and related mobile applications and products we
offer (the “Services” or “Taler Wallet”). This Privacy Statement applies to
your personal data when you use our Services, and does not apply to online
websites or services that we do not own or control.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. We follow a few fundamental principles: We
don’t ask you for personally identifiable information (defined below). That
being said, your contact information, such as your phone number, social media
handle, or email address (depending on how you contact us), may be collected
when you communicate with us, for example to report a bug or other error
related to the Taler Wallet. We don’t share your information with third
parties except when strictly required to deliver you our Services and
products, or to comply with the law. If you have any questions or concerns
about this policy, please reach out to us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:privacy&#37;&#52;&#48;taler-systems&#46;net">privacy<span>&#64;</span>taler-systems<span>&#46;</span>net</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-you-accept-this-policy">
<h2>How you accept this policy<a class="headerlink" href="#how-you-accept-this-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By using our Services or visiting our sites, you agree to the use, disclosure,
and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-personal-information-do-we-collect-from-our-users">
<h2>What personal information do we collect from our users?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-personal-information-do-we-collect-from-our-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally
identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an
individual) (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable
information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are)
(“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and
will tell you how we might collect and use each type.</p>
<p>We do our best to not collect any Personal Information from Taler Wallet
users. We believe that the Taler Wallet never transmits personal information
to our services without at least clear implied consent, and we only process
and retain information with a strict business need. That being said, when
using our Services, we inherently have to collect the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Bank account details necessary when receiving funds from you to top-up your wallet or to transfer funds to you when you are being paid via Taler. At the current experimental stage, only the pseudonym and password you entered in the bank demonstrator is stored.</li>
<li>The amounts being withdrawn or deposited, with associated unique transaction identifiers and cryptographic signatures authorizing the transaction. Note that for purchases, we cannot identify the buyer from the collected data, so when you spend money, we only receive non-personal information.</li>
<li>When you contact us. We may collect certain information if you choose to contact us, for example to report a bug or other error with the Taler Wallet. This may include contact information such as your name, email address or phone number depending on the method you choose to contact us.</li>
</ul>
