.TH TALER\-AUDITOR\-EXCHANGE 1 "Nov 3, 2018" "GNU Taler"

.SH NAME
taler\-auditor\-exchange \- add or remove exchange from auditor's list

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B taler\-auditor\-exchange [--remove] -m EXCHANGE_KEY -u EXCHANGE_URL
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtaler\-auditor\-exchange\fP is a command line tool to be used by an auditor to add or remove an exchange from the list of exchange's audited by the auditor.  You must add an exchange to that list before signing denomination keys with taler\-auditor\-sign or trying to audit it with taler\-auditor or taler\-wire\-auditor.  Afterwards the exchange will be visible via the /exchanges API of the taler\-auditor\-httpd.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-m MASTERKEY,  \-\-exchange-key=MASTERKEY"
Public key of the exchange in Crockford base32 encoding, for example as generated by gnunet\-ecc \-p.
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-u URL,  \-\-auditor-url=URL"
URL of the exchange. The exchange's HTTP API must be available at this address.
.B
.IP "\-r,  \-\-remove"
Instead of adding the exchange, remove it. Note that this will drop ALL data associated with that exchange, including existing auditing information.  So use with extreme care!

.SH BUGS
We should optionally verify the correctness of this exchange's base URL and that it matches the master public key (note that the exchange may still be offline, so it should be possible to bypass such a verfication step).  Furthermore, if we do verification, as a (less secure) convenience option, we should make \-m optional and obtain it from the base URL.
