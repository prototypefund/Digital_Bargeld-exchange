.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtaler\-auditor\fP is a command line tool to be used by an auditor to audit an exchange's database and calculate the current financial state of the exchange (including revenue, amount expected in escrow and risk exposure).  The audit is incremental.  The first audit must be performed with the \-r option to initialize the tables.  The tool reports inconsistencies in the balance or incorrect cryptographic signatures found in the database.  It does NOT check with the bank to see that the incoming and outgoing wire transfers that the bank claims to have matches the exchange's database.
