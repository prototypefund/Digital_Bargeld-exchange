.TH TALER\-EXCHANGE\-BENCHMARK 1 "Jul 25, 2018" "GNU Taler"

.SH NAME
taler\-exchange\-benchmark \- Measure exchange performance.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B taler\-exchange\-benchmark
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtaler\-exchange\-benchmark\fP is a command line tool to measure the time spent to serve withdrawals/deposits/refreshes.  It usually needs a dedicate configuration file where all the services - the exchange and the (fake)bank - listen to URLs not subject to any reverse proxy, as say Nginx.  Moreover, the benchmark runs on a "volatile" database, that means that table are always erased during a single benchmark run.

.SH OPTIONS

.B
.IP "\-c CONFIG_FILENAME,  \-\-config=CONFIG_FILENAME"
(Mandatory) Use CONFIG_FILENAME.

.B
.IP "\-b BANK_URL, --bank-url=BANK_URL"
(Mandatory) The URL where the fakebank listens at.  Must match the host component in the exchange's escrow account "payto" URL.

.B
.IP "\-n HOWMANY_COINS, \-\-coins-number=HOWMANY_COINS"
Defaults to 1.  Specifies how many coins this benchmark should withdraw and spend.  After being spent, each coin will be refreshed with a REFRESH_PROBABILITY probability, which is (hardcoded as) 0.1; future versions of this tool should offer this parameter as a CLI option.

.B
.IP "\-l LOGLEVEL, \-\-log\-level=LOGLEVEL"
GNUnet-compatible log level, takes values "ERROR/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG"

.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
